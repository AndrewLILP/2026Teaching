## STAGE 1: IDENTIFYING AND DEFINING

### 1.1 Problem Definition

#### The Problem (Student's Written Response)

**What problem am I solving?**

As a 15-year-old with a part-time job at Woolworths, I find it hard to keep track of my money. I get paid fortnightly and sometimes I run out of money before the next pay because I don't know where it all goes. Also, my mum said I need to keep track of my work expenses for tax time, but I usually just throw receipts in a shoebox and forget about them.

I want to make a web app that helps me:

- Track my income and expenses  
- See where my money goes  
- Remember which expenses might be tax deductible  
- Keep notes about receipts so I can find them later

---

**Who will use this?**

Teenagers (15–18 years old) who have part-time jobs and need to:

- Budget their money  
- Track spending  
- Organize tax information for the first time

---

**Why is this important?**

Learning to budget early is important. Also, lots of teens don't know they can claim work expenses on tax returns and might miss out on money back. This app makes it easier to remember what you bought for work.
