# Stage 1.3 Social, Ethical, and Legal Considerations

## Student's Response

### Privacy & Data Security

- The app will store personal financial information  
- This is private data and needs to be protected  
- Firebase authentication will be used so only the user can see their own data  
- Each user's data will be stored separately in the database

---

### Data Collection

- **What data is collected:** Income amounts, expense amounts, categories, dates, and notes  
- **Who owns the data:** The user owns their data  
- **How data is protected:** Firebase security rules and user authentication are required

---

### Accessibility

- The app should work on different devices using responsive design  
- Clear labels and buttons will be used  
- Text will be readable with good colour contrast

---

### Ethical Considerations

- The app will not collect data from users under 13 years old (Firebase requires users to be 13+)  
- Users will be informed honestly about what data is collected  
- User data will not be shared or sold

---

### Legal Considerations

- The app will not provide actual tax advice and will only help users organise information  
- The app will not store copies of receipts, only notes about where they are kept  
- The project will follow Firebase Terms of Service

## ✅ What’s Done Well

- Identifies key privacy concerns  
- Demonstrates understanding of data ownership  
- Considers accessibility needs  
- Recognises legal boundaries, such as not giving tax advice

---

## 📈 What Could Improve This to an A-Grade

- Research and reference actual privacy laws, such as the Australian Privacy Principles  
- Consider children’s online privacy requirements (e.g. COPPA) in more depth  
- Plan specific security measures, such as password requirements and data encryption  
- Consider data retention policies (e.g. how long data is kept and account deletion options)  
- Consider inclusivity more broadly, including different cultural attitudes to money and diverse family situations
