# STAGE 2: RESEARCHING AND PLANNING

## 2.1 Research Phase

### Existing Solutions Research (Student's Work)

I looked at these existing budgeting apps:

#### 1. Mint

**What's good:**
- Automatic categorization
- Nice looking charts
- Links to bank account

**What's not good:**
- Too complicated for teens
- US-focused
- Requires bank linking (my parents won't let me)

#### 2. Goodbudget

**What's good:**
- Envelope budgeting system
- Simple interface
- Manual entry

**What's not good:**
- No tax features
- Old-fashioned design
- Costs money for full version

#### 3. Spendee

**What's good:**
- Good design
- Manual entry
- Good charts

**What's not good:**
- No tax tracking
- Some features cost money

**What I learned:**
- Manual entry is better for my age group (don't have bank accounts linked)
- Categories are really important
- Charts help you see where money goes
- Most apps don't think about tax for teens
- Simple is better than complicated

### Technology Research (Student's Notes)

**Why I chose these technologies:**

- Works in any browser
- Don't need to install anything
- Can access from school, home, or phone

#### Chart.js:
- Free and easy to use
- Makes good looking charts
- Good documentation and tutorials
- Lots of examples online

#### Firebase:
- Free for small projects
- Don't need to set up a server
- Has built-in login system
- Real-time database is easier than SQL
- Good tutorials on YouTube

#### GitHub:
- Free for students
- Can show my code to teacher
- Backup if my computer breaks
- Can host website for free with GitHub Pages
