#### 2.3 Project Planning
### Project Timeline (Student's Work)
## GitHub Project Board Setup:
- Student has created a GitHub Project with these columns:

- To Do
- In Progress
- Done

- Week-by-Week Plan:
- Week, Tasks, Status
- 1-2 Define problem, research existing apps, create requirements✅ Done
- 3-4 Design wireframes, plan database, write algorithms✅ Done
- 5 Set up Firebase project, create HTML structure - To Do
- 6 Build dashboard and add transaction forms - To Do
- 7 Add Chart.js visualization - To Do
- 8 Build transactions list and tax page - To Do
- 9 Testing and bug fixing - To Do
- 10 Final evaluation and documentation - To Do

## Files I Need to Create:

- index.html (login page)
- dashboard.html (main page)
- transactions.html (all transactions)
- tax.html (tax deductible items)
- styles.css (all styling)
- app.js (main JavaScript code)
- firebase-config.js (Firebase setup)

3. Create an account to start tracking

## Made for Computing Technology class


## ✅ What's Done Well 
- Clear project timeline with realistic milestones
- Organized task breakdown
- GitHub repository planned with good structure
- README explains project purpose

## 📈 What Could Improve This to A-grade:**
- Add estimated hours for each task
- Identify dependencies (can't test until code is written)
- Create more detailed GitHub issues for each feature
- Use labels on GitHub (bug, enhancement, documentation)
- Add screenshots/mockups to README
- Include installation instructions for Firebase setup
- Consider risk management (what if Firebase is down? what if I get stuck?)
- Add a .gitignore file to plan (don't commit sensitive keys)
